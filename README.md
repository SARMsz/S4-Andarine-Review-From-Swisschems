<h2>What Is Swisschems S4 (Andarine)?</h2>
<p>Swisschems S4, also known as Andarine, is a Selective Androgen Receptor Modulator (SARM). It binds to androgen receptors in muscle and bone tissue. This leads to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Lean muscle growth</li>
  <li>Improved bone density</li>
  <li>Enhanced fat loss</li>
  <li>Better strength and endurance</li>
</ul>
<p>Compared to traditional anabolic steroids, Andarine has fewer side effects. It doesn’t convert to estrogen, so there’s less risk of water retention or gynecomastia.</p>

<h2>How I Tested and Ranked Swisschems S4</h2>
<p>I ran a six-week cycle of Swisschems S4 at 50mg per day. Here’s my step-by-step approach:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Baseline Measurements:</strong> I measured my body weight, body fat percentage, and 1-rep max on squat and bench.</li>
  <li><strong>Dosage Consistency:</strong> I took my daily dose at the same time each morning to maintain stable blood levels.</li>
  <li><strong>Diet and Training:</strong> I followed a lean bulking diet with 10% surplus calories and a strength-focused training plan (5×5 compound lifts).</li>
  <li><strong>Weekly Check-ins:</strong> Every week, I logged weight, strength, and photos to track progress.</li>
  <li><strong>Side Effect Log:</strong> I noted any changes in vision, mood, or appetite.</li>
</ol>
<p>After six weeks, I compared my data. My lean muscle mass increased by 4 pounds, body fat dropped by 1.5%, and my squat 1RM went up by 25 lbs. Strength gains were steady and noticeable.</p>

<h2>Why I Rank Swisschems S4 Highly</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Potent Lean Gains:</strong> Andarine targets muscle tissue selectively, so gains are quality lean mass.</li>
  <li><strong>Fat Loss Support:</strong> I saw visible muscle definition mid-cycle, thanks to slight metabolic boost.</li>
  <li><strong>Ease of Use:</strong> Oral capsule form, no injections or messy liquids.</li>
  <li><strong>Mild Side Effects:</strong> Only minor vision tint that cleared in a few hours.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, this SARM scored high in my personal ranking for effectiveness, user-friendliness, and safety profile.</p>
